    <h3>NEERAZSAI VEERANKI</h3>

    <p>I'm a travel enthusiast who loves to go on a very long road trips, eespecially on motorcycles. I recently got this interest after seeing, people travelling places around the world. my dream is to explore an unexplored place and its beauty on motorcycle. Ofcourse its a very stressfull and energy consuming thing to drive for that long periods of time, but i believe with a right company of friends it would be a life time memory to cherish.</p>
    
    <h2>Harry Potter</h2>

    <p>One of the main reasons that the series has become so loved is it's attention to detail and the costumes, clothing choices and descriptions of the characters. Think Harry's lightening-shaped scar, his broken glasses and his "mother's eyes"</p>
